**Posit Team**: A modular platform of Posit's three professional products for **scaling** data science analytic work, **sharing** data products with your key stakeholders, and **managing** R and Python packages within your environment.

Posit Team includes Posit Workbench, Posit Connect, and Posit Package Manager.

-   **Posit Workbench** is a professional development environment used to perform analyses and create data products using R or Python. Available editors include the RStudio IDE, Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, and VS Code.

-   **Posit Connect** is a professional publishing platform and execution engine used to internally host the data products your teams create in R and Python; connecting the data products you create to the end users who need to see them. Share Quarto, Shiny, R Markdown, Plumber APIs, Jupyter Notebooks, Dash, Flask, Streamlit, Bokeh, and FastAPIs in one convenient place.

-   **Posit Package Manager** is a professional solution to organize and centralize R and Python packages across the enterprise for increased governance and reproducibility.
